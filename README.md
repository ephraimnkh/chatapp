# Chatapp

This is a chat application using sockets, Express, Angular 6 and Google Cloud API for text to speech functions.
You can use two different browsers to simulate two different users chatting.

After sending a message you can use the "Listen to your Message" button to convert your last message to
speech, then you can play it at the bottom of the page.

Build the project using "ng build --watch". Then in another window run the server by saying "npm install" then "npm start" or "node server.js"

The server is at "http://localhost:8080"
